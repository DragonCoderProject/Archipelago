			\subsection{Game overview} \vspace{-5mm}
				\subsubsection{Motivation} \vspace{-5mm}
					\par \begingroup
					\leftskip=2cm
					\noindent
							The idea for writing a game came in to my head 2 years ago. I searched a game which was interesting, have a nice story, but where is too a PvP motive. I did not find any interesting, then I thought, why not make your own game. I knew, that it not so easy, but I wanted try to do that. First time I have written a easy text game in a console, but I wanted more. I wanted write a game, game on a new level, which no body made, something new in gamedev and I think, that Archipelago can be so one game, when all system will be implemented. Archipelago should be a new generation game, which have not only elements of normal Role Playing Game, but too elements of multiplayer. The game is something like a protest of a new era in the game developing or maybe a shit era for the player and games. Since 2008 it is really hard to find any good games, which give the player a big story, which will really interesting, but has too elements of combat between player 
					\par \endgroup
				\subsubsection{Genre} \vspace{-5mm}
					\par \begingroup
					\leftskip=2cm
					\noindent
							For the begin the game should be a RPG game, but with the time should the game evolve
							to MMO with elements of japan religion. 
					\par \endgroup
				\subsubsection{Target Audience} \vspace{-5mm}
					\par \begingroup
					\leftskip=2cm
					\noindent
							The game shouldn‘t have “special” target audience, the game should be for all people, it isn’t important if there are sink or healthy. I want that all have a possibility to game and I will try to write necessary systems and build a necessary hardware. 
					\par \endgroup
				\subsubsection{Game Flow Summary} \vspace{-5mm}
					\par \begingroup
					\leftskip=2cm
					\noindent
							The Player moves through the game with help of keyboard and in later version with help of extra controller, if he/she will want to use this. The description of the hardware is to find in another part of document. 
					\par \endgroup
				\subsubsection{Look and Feel} \vspace{-5mm}
					\par \begingroup
					\leftskip=2cm
					\noindent
							The basic look should be a 2D look with all religion elements of japan religion and japan map. The player should have a feel like being in the old japan with super hero. It ca be really hard to do without VR, but it will the next idea, next level of the game, next system which should make the game impossible to imitate
					\par \endgroup
				\subsubsection{Project Scope} \vspace{-5mm}
					\paragraph{Number of locations} \vspace{-5mm}

				\subsubsection{Gameplay} \vspace{-5mm}
					\paragraph{Game Progression} \vspace{-5mm}
						\par \begingroup
						\leftskip=2cm
						\noindent
								The game progression or player progression is a little slow, because of a difficulty of the game, numbers of mission and drop from any bosses. It’s hard to say, how much time the player will need, but the item shop, if any one will be there, will not give a big  protrusion as player, they not use them, because of a game systems. But the progression is so designed that the player has to use or should use the multi-field progression mode in the game, depending on what the character is for.

The first controller should be only a prototype and should be only for the hand and make possible to steerage the character movement and usage of skills. In the next versions the controller will be updated to the form of a “overalls”. More about controller:
									\par \begingroup
									\leftskip=2.5cm

											- The $2^nd$ controller should be a hand-held keyboard, it mean scarlet that will be put on the hand and has 5 buttons (1 for one finger) \\
											- The $3^rd$ controller is basically the same as the second controller but should be partially used as a mouse with buttons \\
											- Objects Apart from the basic controllers, can be use another small parts, which be connected to the body and will produce a small amount of tension, which should give the player the feeling of being hurt

							\par \begingroup
							\leftskip=2cm
							\noindent
									It is not a constant economy of the game because of the players, which will ground the basic of game economy, when the will trade with each other. From developer side will the player get only a special currency. Generally in the game will 3 currencies (version 1.0.0), this mean one of them (Archipelago token) will a normal currency, which the player will use always, when he/she want to buy or to sell something. Another one is more a extension of first one, this means that the Archipelago paper will be like 100 000 of the Archipelago token. The last currency is more a extension of the game, because it will give the player possibility to buy a special items, which will make his/her game a little easier. The game economy will be controlled 24/7 and when the game developer will see, that something is going wrong, then he will take a part in the “refactoring process”.

						\noindent
								Range system will be something like a extra bonuses system, but the player will get the range points for: combat with players and monster, missions, events. But what is really enjoying that the player can have not only a positive range, but too negative range and this one will make the game harder for the player, then with negative range your all bonus will be 2 times smaller

				\subsubsection{Game Options} \vspace{-5mm}
					\par \begingroup
					\leftskip=2cm
					\noindent
							We or I as developer know, that some people do not have a good graphic card or a good processors, so I want come out to the player and make playing possible for all people, which will want do that. The games options will give possibility all to game in The Archipelago. Most important options like choose between processor and graphic card or uniform look for all all monster, which reduce lags and problems with rendering of monster etc. The player will get too possibility to influence the sound of the game and turns it on and off.

						\noindent
								It really hard to describe the game progression by Archipelago, because of so much possibility to progression of the character. On the one side will the player get possibility to progression his character by PvP mode and on the another hand with PvM mode. Really important fact is, that the player need to use both modes, when he/sie want get all missions and skills. The game progression will be another for player with the 1 lvl and another for someone with 50’s lvl. The player can get a positive or negative progression. Negative progression mean, player lose experience points, when the player is going lose in PvM and PvP. The player will have possibility to prevent the player in his/her progression, this mean bigger rivalry.
